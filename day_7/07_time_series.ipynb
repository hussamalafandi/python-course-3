    "# Stock Market Time Series Forecasting with Multiple Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use historical stock market data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) loaded from a local CSV file (`HistoricalQuotes.csv`) to demonstrate several time series forecasting methods. We will predict the next day's closing price using different approaches, starting from the simplest to more advanced methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the forecasting approaches we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Forecast:** The simplest method that assumes the next value is equal to the last observed value.\n",
    "2. **Autoregressive (AR) Forecast:** Forecasting using the average of the previous *k* observations (here, *k* = 3).\n",
    "3. **Exponential Smoothing Forecast:** A weighted average of past observations where more recent values are given higher weight.\n",
    "4. **Linear Trend Forecast:** Fitting a linear model (a special case of linear regression) to capture the trend.\n",
    "5. **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extending the linear trend model by incorporating additional features such as trading volume and moving averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formulations for the methods are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes that the next value is the same as the last observed value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_{t+1} = y_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autoregressive (AR) Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple AR(3) model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_{t+1} = \\frac{y_t + y_{t-1} + y_{t-2}}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential Smoothing Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{t+1} = \\alpha y_t + (1-\\alpha) F_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with smoothing factor $\\alpha$ (0 < $\\alpha$ < 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Trend Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple linear trend model assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_t = a + b\\,t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a special case of linear regression where time is the only predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend the linear model to include additional predictors. For example, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\,t + \\beta_2\\,V_t + \\beta_3\\,MA_t + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ V_t $ is the trading volume and $ MA_t $ is a moving average of the closing price. The coefficients $\\beta$ are estimated via least squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y $$\n",
